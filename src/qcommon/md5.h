/*
* This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
* The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
* written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
* This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
*
* Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
* This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
* except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
* with every copy.
*
* To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
* MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
* needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
* will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
